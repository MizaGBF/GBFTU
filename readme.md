Web page with tool and utilities for Granblue Fantasy.  
Click [Here](https://mizagbf.github.io/GBFUT) to access it.  
  
# Note  
Like my other projects, this project requires [GBFML](https://github.com/MizaGBF/GBFML) to be alongside it.  
The folder structure on the server is as such:  
```
Root Folder/
├── GBFML/
├── GBFAL/
├── GBFAP/
└── GBFUT/
```  
If you wish to run a test server with Python for example, uses `python -m http.server` in the Root Folder.
